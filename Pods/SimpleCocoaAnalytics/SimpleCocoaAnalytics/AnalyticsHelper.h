 AnalyticsHelper is a simple, singleton interface for recording and sending events to your google analytics account.
 
 This class is *not* thread safe. All calls to it should be performed from the main thread. Reports are sent on a background thread. If the send fails, an error event will be sent the next time analytics are reported.
